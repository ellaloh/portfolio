          With both empathy and an interest in design, I first worked as a Supervisor at Uniqlo
          where I learned how much a piece of clothing could effect the livelihood of people.
          My manager told me on my first day of a Mongolian nomadic ware-seller, who because
          of a donation of a Uniqlo down jacket, could travel lighter and farther on his horse
          everyday, which increased his standard of living.
        </p><p>
          Throughout my career in fashion I developed and optimized large-scale product lines,
          conducted trend research, sketched ideas, followed-up with vendors for prototypes, all the
          while in constant contact with our clients.
        </p><p>
          Yet, I realized I couldn’t work knowing I wasn’t making a large enough impact. I
          wanted to hear more from the user, so it felt natural to move into user experience design.
          Incorporating both my natural empathy and creative skills, I am open to UX/UI/Product/Interaction Designer
          positions to build both user-centric and appealing digital products and solutions.

          <i>Cultural thing that I loved:
          South Korean bus stops provide screens that show time of arrival and location of the
          upcoming buses in real-time. After asking some bus passengers, my assumption is that
          the buses would be delayed or not come at all. The solution provides not only better customer service but also dependability which may decrease the number of car drivers.
